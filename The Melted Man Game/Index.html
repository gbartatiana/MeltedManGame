                <p>When the weather does not lend itself to an outdoor game, 
                   we must find an occupation for our children.</p> 
                <p>The Melted man Game, which is a derivative of the hangmanâ€™s game, 
                    is ideal to occupy children indoors.</p> 
                <p>Playful and fun, this electronic version of the game is easy to use.</p>
                <p>Basically, this game is played with two people, using a paper and a pencil.</p> 
                <p>In this electronic version, the second person is replaced by the computer and, 
                    paper and pencil are replaced by the computer screen and the keyboard.</p> 
                <p>The goal of the game is to find a word by guessing the letters that compose it 
                    before the man is more than a simple pile of water on the ground.</pr>
                </p>
